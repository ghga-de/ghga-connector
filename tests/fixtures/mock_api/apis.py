"""Mocks of the APIs the connector calls, served from a `MockRouter`.

Every API is modeled once, by a class registering all of its endpoints on the router it
is handed. An endpoint answers with whatever handler is currently assigned to the
matching `on_...` attribute, so a test only states how the endpoints it cares about
behave and inherits a successful response for the rest:
```
upload_api.on_delete_file = respond(404, json={"exception_id": "fileUploadNotFound"})
```
Handlers come from `respond`, or are any callable taking the request plus the endpoint's
path variables as keyword arguments. They may be `async`, which is what lets an
integration test answer out of the S3 testcontainer. Everything reaching a mock is
recorded in its `requests`, so assertions about what the connector sent belong after the
call under test, not inside a handler where a failure would surface as a request error.

The `mock_apis` fixture at the bottom serves all of them at once, and is what every test
uses: a unit test reaches for the one mock it cares about, an integration test lets the
connector bootstrap itself from the WKVS mock and walk the rest.
