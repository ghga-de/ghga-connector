"""Mocks of the APIs the connector calls, served from a `MockRouter`.

Every API is modeled once, by a class registering all of its endpoints on the router it
is handed. An endpoint answers with whatever handler is currently assigned to the
matching `on_...` attribute, so a test only states how the endpoints it cares about
behave and inherits a successful response for the rest:
```
upload_api.on_delete_file = respond(404, json={"exception_id": "fileUploadNotFound"})
```
Handlers come from `respond`, or are any callable taking the request plus the endpoint's
path variables as keyword arguments. They may be `async`, which is what lets an
integration test answer out of the S3 testcontainer. Everything reaching a mock is
recorded in its `requests`, so assertions about what the connector sent belong after the
call under test, not inside a handler where a failure would surface as a request error.

The per-API fixtures below serve one API each from `mock_router`, for unit tests that
exercise a single client; a test module using one has to import `mock_router` and
`set_runtime_test_config` as well. Integration tests want all of the APIs at once and
take `mock_apis` from `tests.fixtures.mock_api.joint` instead.
